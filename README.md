**SuperClass: New methods of acquisition and classification for high content screening of membrane receptor organization and dynamics using super resolution microscopy**

Neurotransmitter receptor trafficking is highly modulated by neuronal activity and tunes synaptic functions in physiological and pathological states. Receptor mobility, best measured by live super-resolution microscopy, is thus a key parameter and may be the target of pharmacological compounds. Unfortunately, there is no existing methodology allowing screening and quantifying this property in large number of conditions. This project aims to develop new acquisition, quantification and classification methods for HCS super-resolution microscopy. Through this collaborative work, we expect to provide an integrated solution for multi-well plates observation to monitor active protein organization and dynamics under several tens conditions accompanied by rigorous classification methods.
